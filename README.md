# FaceMaskDetection
This Project detects whether an individual is wearing a mask or not by using Machine learning.

The main aim of creating this project is to embed it in a real-time scenario, with the help of raspberry pi, Arduino etc in public transport gates, shopping malls or shops, hospitals, schools and university to detect the person without masks for safety precaution and slower the spread of the coronavirus.

This model uses OpenCV for image detection and processing, further keras, tensorflow and mobilenet is also used.
